Game Intro Synopsis (WIP): You are living in the US and the year is 2094. One day, drop pods rained down and in each one, there were outlandish creatures that started attacking everyone. A lot of the military is not even in the country, so people are having to fight for themselves aside from a few scattered militias. 

Gameplay: Enter commands through the buttons. There is a map view and there will be more visuals later.

Weapons: Anything you can pick up can be used as a weapon, so anything laying around if you have no other options.


Planned but not implemented yet:

NPC: Players can interact and attempt to communicate with any NPC, including enemies.

Enemies: There will be exotic enemies, with many different traits and ways to fight them. 

Damage System: No health bars, everything has a hitbox which contains organs and everything else inside of it. Different things can be made into armor such as wood, floor tiles, and steel, and they will have realistic ballistic properties.
